A thrilling masterpiece from start to finish
Could have been better, but the acting was decent
The plot was confusing, but the visuals were stunning
An instant classic. Highly recommended
I expected more from the director, but it was still enjoyable
The soundtrack was amazing, but the story lacked depth
A fun movie to watch with friends, nothing too serious
The twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat
The character development was weak, but the action scenes were great
Beautiful cinematography, but the pacing was slow
A heartwarming tale that left me with a smile
The lead actor gave a stellar performance
I wasn’t a fan of the ending, but overall a good watch
The special effects were out of this world
A bit too predictable, but still entertaining
Great for a casual movie night, but nothing groundbreaking
The chemistry between the main characters was fantastic
The dialogue felt forced at times, but the movie had its moments
A refreshing take on the genre. I loved it
Too many plot holes to fully enjoy the story
It started off slow but picked up pace in the second half
The comedic moments were on point
Not my favorite, but it had some redeeming qualities
A visually stunning film with a forgettable plot
The emotional scenes were really well done
I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it
The villain was well-written and truly menacing
A good movie to pass the time, but not very memorable
The ending left me wanting more in the best way possible
A solid movie, but it didn’t live up to the hype
